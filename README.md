**Non-IT to IT Career Switch – Full Data Analysis Project**

**About the Project**

In today’s fast-evolving tech world, many professionals are switching from non-technical backgrounds into IT.
This project explores the key factors behind these career transitions using a complete end-to-end data analysis process:
Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing
MySQL for structured querying and insights
Power BI for visual storytelling and dashboard creation

As someone who personally transitioned into the tech industry, this project reflects not only data—but also my own career journey.

**Tools & Skills Applied**

Excel (Data cleaning, pivot analysis)

MySQL (Database design, SQL querying)

Power BI (Dashboard design, DAX measures, visual storytelling)

Data storytelling and dashboard interactivity


**Project Workflow**

Data Cleaning:
Cleaned missing and inconsistent values in Excel
Created pivot tables for quick validation
SQL Querying:
Built a relational database in MySQL
Wrote advanced SQL queries for in-depth insights
Power BI Dashboarding:
Designed an interactive, professional dashboard
Used KPIs, slicers, and multiple charts for storytelling

Impact of Job Satisfaction (Line Chart)
Career Change Interest (Pie Chart)
Education Level of Switchers (Donut Chart)
Experience Before Switching (Area Chart)

Slicers:
➔ Gender and Field of Study for personalized filtering

**SQL Query Insights**

1. Switches by Gender
Who is switching more?

2. Field of Study vs Switches
Which academic fields contribute the most?

3. Career Change Interest
How interested were people in switching careers?


**Key Insights**

- People with high job satisfaction still switch to IT, suggesting evolving personal goals.
- Education level and certifications play a major role in successful transitions.
- Many career switchers showed strong interest in tech, mentorship, and adaptability.
- Years of experience doesn’t block switching—curiosity and readiness matter more.

**Why This Project is Important**

This isn’t just another data project—
It mirrors the real-life transformation journey from Non-IT to IT, backed by data.
Through this project, I demonstrated my hands-on ability to:
Collect, clean, and prepare data
Extract valuable insights with SQL
Design an executive-level dashboard in Power BI
Tell a compelling data story
